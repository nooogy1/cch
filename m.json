Thirty years means a set of 30 individually wrapped cards for 30 days of celebratory opening! But what are the cards, you ask? We\u2019ve included one card from each year in Magic\u2019s history, starting with 1993. And it wouldn\u2019t be Secret Lair without cool art, so we\u2019ve gone through our rolodex of Secret Lair collaborators and invited a bunch of them to the party, creating all new looks for every card. But that\u2019s STILL not all\u2014any card you open has a 30% chance (get it?) of being foil, shining as bright as a decorative winter star. Speaking of decorative, we\u2019re throwing in some sticker tabs so you have the option of hanging the boosters around your house!\r\n<br><br>So come and join us for this special crack-a-pack countdown to the year of our 30th anniversary. They are timed to arrive with the start of December, so you can open one each day (yeah, December has 31 days, but right now it's all about 30!) or even crack them all at once the second they arrive. However you wish to celebrate, we\u2019ve got the kit just for you!\r\n<br><br>All cards are English only."

Yargle can smell your fear.\r\n<br>\u2022 It doesn't matter if you're naughty or nice, Yargle's gaping maw is large enough to accommodate both kinds of children at once.\r\n<br>\u2022 Save your milk and cookies for December. Consider tying a goat to a fence on the outskirts of your property, and maybe he'll get full.\r\n<br>\u2022 Yargle never gets full.\r\n<br><br>It seems a single card in Dominaria was not enough to appease this beautiful, cruel spirit, so we have printed several popular cards with new art celebrating his glorious visage. We fondly remember the <s>sacrifices</s> artists who undertook this daunting challenge: Dmitry Burmak, Jehan Choo, Matt Dixon, Chuck Lukacs, and Franz Vohwinkel. May Yargle have mercy on their souls."

We asked them to make five cards, and they sent us five wild rectangles, each inspired by an infamous MSCHF drop like Guns 2 Swords, MSCHF Box, and Satan Shoes. Unrestrained frames, unique art, and fancy treatments (that Blood Moon is blindingly blingy) make this a once-in-a-lifetime Secret Lair drop that will spark conversations for years to come."

With playful new art from Jack Teagle and five cards that synergize around Animar, Soul of Elements, this drop can inspire your next commander deck or just give you something to admire while dipping your Italian beef into some delicious au jus.\r\n<br>\r\nTo top it all off, four promo cards including a Foil Retro Frame Serra the Benevolent, a Foil Future Sight Frame Ponder, a Foil Future Sight Frame The First Sliver, and a \u201cSecond City\u201d playtest card.
